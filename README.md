## How does it work?

To make it easier to follow there is a page for each major step in the process:

- Index page triggers a GET request to `/api/auth` that triggers a redirect to Github page for authentication
  - On success Github redirects back to `/auth/?code=<github auth code>`
- Auth page triggers a POST request to `/api/auth` to exchange the github auth code for an access token
  - On success navigates to `/checkout` with access token as state param
- Checkout page triggers a POST request to `/api/checkout` creating a Stripe Checkout Session
  - On success navigates to the Checkout Sesssion URL returned from the function when on completing redirects back to `/success/?sessionId=<Stripe Checkout Session ID>`
- Success Page triggers a POST request to `/api/checkout` retreivng the Stripe Checkout Session
  - On sucess displays message returned from the function.

## Make it your own

1.  **Prerequisite**

    - A Stripe Secret Key (get one by creating a Stripe account)
    - A Stripe Price Id (get one by making a product, then a product price)
    - A GitHub OAuth App (create one in [your Github settings](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-oauth-apps/creating-an-oauth-app))
    - A private Github repo to sell (create one on GitHub)
    - A Github Personal Access Token for the owner of above repo (create one in [your Github settings](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token))

2.  **Develop**

    - To get started clone this repo locally and run `yarn install` to add all necessary packages.
    - Create your own `.env.development` by copying `.env.example`: `cp .env.example .env.development`
    - Login with Stripe CLI: `stripe login` and follow the directions
    - Forward Stripe event to the Stripe Webook: `stripe listen --forward-to http://localhost:8000/api/stripe-webhook`
    - Fill out `.env.development` with your own data and you are ready for `yarn develop`

3.  **Deploy**

You can deploy this example on Gatsby Cloud by [connecting your repo Gatsby Cloud](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/how-to/previews-deploys-hosting/deploying-to-gatsby-cloud/#set-up-an-existing-gatsby-site).
